# MARL Papers with Code
This is a collection of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) papers with code. I have selected some relatively important papers with open source code and categorized them by time and method.

For MARL papers and MARL resources, please refer to [Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning papers](https://github.com/TimeBreaker/Multi-Agent-Reinforcement-Learning-papers) and [MARL Resources Collection](https://github.com/TimeBreaker/MARL-resources-collection).

I will continually update this repository and I welcome suggestions. (missing important papers, missing categories, invalid links, etc.) This is only a first draft so far and I'll add more resources in the next few months.

This repository is not for commercial purposes.
